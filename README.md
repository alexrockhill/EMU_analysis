# Welcome
Welcome to the analysis of intracranial data from epilepsy patients at Oregon Health & Science University written by Alex Rockhill (arockhil@uoregon.edu) at the University of Oregon department of Human Physiology. 

At this point to replicate and walk through the analysis, you will need:
1) To install python, using Anaconda is recommended (https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section)
2) Install MNE including the development environment, see https://mne.tools/dev/install/mne_python.html
3) Download the Github Respository for this analysis (https://github.com/alexrockhill/EMU_analysis)
   a) Change your working directory to where you want to put the project
   b) Run `git clone https://github.com/alexrockhill/EMU_analysis` in a shell/terminal
4) Download the BIDS formatted data on OpenNeuro (link)

Then you can run each python file in order, e.g. `python 2_gui.py`

For information on how this dataset was converted to BIDS, see https://mne.tools/mne-bids/dev/auto_examples/convert_ieeg_to_bids.html
